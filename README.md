# Project
Interface for a learning journal web application. The main (index) page lists journal entry titles, dates and tags associated with the entry. Each journal entry title links to a detail page that displays the title, date, time spent, the journal entry, resources related to the learning, and tags. Each tag links to entries page where all entries associated with that tag are listed.

The application lets the user add or edit journal entries. When adding or editing a journal entry, the application prompts the user for title, date, time spent, what they learned, resources to remember and tags. The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed in a blog style website.
